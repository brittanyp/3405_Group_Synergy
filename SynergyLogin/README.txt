Inside the synergy folder is the necessary files to
ustilise the login system.

The registration.sql file is the necesarry DB,
if you change the DB connection details, check the 'sever.php' file
and change the connection details there, currently they are set to the localhost
configured for MySQL/ PhpMyAdmin.

Have fun.
